Certainly! It seems like you're asking for a sample dataset of 100 rows, each representing a Malaysian citizen with 5 columns of information. Here's a simplified example:


| Name           | Age | Gender | Address                | Occupation       |
|----------------|-----|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Ahmad Abdullah | 30  | Male   | 123 Jalan Merdeka, KL  | Engineer         |
| Siti Aminah    | 25  | Female | 456 Persiaran Putra, PJ| Teacher          |
| Mohd Hassan    | 40  | Male   | 789 Jalan Rakyat, Klang| Doctor           |
| Nor Fatimah    | 35  | Female | 101 Lebuhraya Sejahtera| Accountant       |
| Ali Bin Ismail | 28  | Male   | 202 Jalan Gemilang, JB | IT Specialist    |
| Farah Yusof    | 22  | Female | 303 Persiaran Bahagia,Ipoh| Student       |
| Aziz Ibrahim   | 45  | Male   | 404 Lorong Damai, Alor Setar| Businessman  |
| Zainab Tan     | 32  | Female | 505 Jalan Seri Jaya, Seremban| Marketing   |
| Kamal Raja     | 38  | Male   | 606 Jalan Sentosa, Penang| Architect      |
| Maya Lim       | 26  | Female | 707 Jalan Indah, Kota Bharu| Nurse         |
| ...            | ... | ...    | ...                    | ...             |


You can continue this pattern with additional rows, filling in realistic data for each column. The columns in this example are: Name, Age, Gender, Address, and Occupation. Adjust the data as needed based on your specific requirements. Keep in mind that this is entirely fictional and created for illustrative purposes.
